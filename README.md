# Reddit Scraper
A Python application that scrapes Reddit for potential marketing leads, analyzes them with GPT models, and identifies high-value opportunities for a cron job scheduling SaaS.

## 📋 Overview

This tool uses a combination of Reddit's API and OpenAI's GPT models to:

1. Scrape relevant subreddits for discussions about scheduling, automation, and related topics
2. Identify posts that express pain points solvable by a cron job scheduling SaaS
3. Score and analyze these posts to find high-quality marketing leads
4. Store results in a local SQLite database for review

The application maintains a balance between focused (90%) and exploratory (10%) subreddits, intelligently refreshing the exploratory list based on discoveries. This exploration process happens automatically as part of the main workflow.

## 🚀 Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Reddit API credentials ([create an app here](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps))
- OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cronlytic-reddit-scraper.git
   cd cronlytic-reddit-scraper
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables by copying `.env.template` to `.env`:
   ```
   cp .env.template .env
   ```

5. Edit `.env` and add your API credentials:
   ```
   REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
   REDDIT_USER_AGENT="script:cronlytic-reddit-scraper:v1.0 (by /u/yourusername)"
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   ```

## 🔧 Configuration

Configure the application by editing `config/config.yaml`. Key settings include:

- **Target subreddits**: Primary subreddits and exploratory subreddit settings
- **Post age range**: Only analyze posts 5-90 days old
- **API rate limits**: Prevent hitting Reddit API limits
- **OpenAI models**: Which models to use for filtering and deep analysis
- **Monthly budget**: Cap total API spending
- **Scoring weights**: How to weight different factors when scoring posts

## 🏃‍♀️ Running

### One-time Run

To run the pipeline once:

```
python3 main.py
```

This will:
1. Scrape posts from configured primary subreddits
2. Automatically discover and scrape from exploratory subreddits
3. Analyze all posts with GPT models
4. Store results in the database

### Scheduled Operation

To run the pipeline daily at the configured time (TODO, Fix scheduler):

```
python3 scheduler/daily_scheduler.py
```

## 📊 Results

Results are stored in a SQLite database at `data/db.sqlite`. You can query it using:

```sql
-- Today's top leads
SELECT * FROM posts
WHERE processed_at >= DATE('now')
ORDER BY roi_weight DESC, relevance_score DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Posts with specific tag
SELECT * FROM posts
WHERE tags LIKE '%serverless%'
ORDER BY processed_at DESC;
```

You can also use the included results viewer:

```
python check_results.py stats       # Show database statistics
python check_results.py top -n 5    # Show top 5 posts
python check_results.py tag serverless  # Show posts with the 'serverless' tag
```

## 🔒 Cost Controls

The application includes several safeguards to control API costs:

- Monthly budget cap (configurable in `config.yaml`)
- Efficient batch processing using OpenAI's Batch API
- Pre-filtering with less expensive models before using more powerful models
- Cost tracking and logging

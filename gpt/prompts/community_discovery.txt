You are an professional product manager. Your task is to help identify where users express unmet needs, frustrations, or wishes for new tools/websites across Reddit communities.
Based on the following top-performing Reddit posts (titles and summaries), recommend a ranked list of 12 adjacent subreddits that might contain similar pain points or lead opportunities.

For each recommended subreddit, provide:
- A short rationale
- An estimate of:
  - % of posts with pain point signals
  - % of comments asking for solutions
  - Engagement level (low, medium, high)

Only include subreddits that:
- Have developer, DevOps, startup, or automation discussions
- Are active in the past month
- Are not already on the main tracked list

Respond strictly in JSON array format, like this（ without "```json"）:
[
  {
    "subreddit": "selfhosted",
    "reason": "Many users complain about needing to run jobs locally and seek serverless tools.",
    "pain_signal_pct": 60,
    "solution_requests_pct": 40,
    "engagement_level": "high"
  },
  ...
]
